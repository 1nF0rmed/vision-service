# Robot Arm Vision Service

## Bigger picture
The Robot Arm is meant to replicate human actions on a deterministic action environment.
In this case picking and placing blocks.

## What does this service do?
This service is meant take data from two video captures and provide the following information:
- current environment state
- determine if human action was taken
-- if human action, then the action taken along with objects interacted with

This is most likely going evolve over time.
